Capstone project for Laura Peckyno PerScholas cohort #31

This application is a resource for older adults interested in finding senior discounts. I've tried to limit this to Pennsylvania to make the data scraping a little more managable. No public database was available for use, so I scraped data from many websites to generate my own database of discounts and social services. These are categorized and, when possible, include descriptions, urls, and eligibility details.

The site allows users to find discounts by category, featured status, or by search terms.

FUTURE WORK
I'd like to work out the bug in the user authentication. It's definitely a prop I'm not passing quite right. The data is passing to the backend and the database properly and I'm seeing tokens generated. But the page components aren't rendering properly with the user data. I will continue to debug.
