Capstone project for Laura Peckyno
PerScholas cohort #31

This application is a resource for older adults interested in finding senior discounts. I've tried to limit this to Pennsylvania to make the data scraping a little more managable. 
No public database was available for use, so I scraped data from many websites to generate my own database of discounts and social services. These are categorized and, when possible, include descriptions, urls, and eligibility details.

The site allows users to find discounts by category, featured status, or by search terms.
